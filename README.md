- 👋 Hi, I’m @fpj-engmgr aka Frank Jansen. 
- As I merged my original profile into my work one at Red Hat, I thought it would be a good time to start a clean one, and get back to some of the areas where I like to explore and play.
- 👀 One of these areas is to get back into hacking the kernel, which is one of my passions. I've had a ton of fun in the past working on SCSI and networking, which I want to rekindle! 
- 🌱 I’m currently getting up to date on the more modern kernels (embarrassed to that my last serious work was on 3.x kernels)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that involves storage and/or networking!
- 📫 You can find me here and also ping me on Twitter @FJPhotography
